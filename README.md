## About

* This was a fantastic project by Jack Herrington, my very first with GraphQL.      
* I reviewed a few chat concepts (I had already built a couple of chat apps), and learned to use GraphQL technology.   
* I used Apollo, Shards, Webpack and Yarn for the first time.  
* I am super satisfied that I was able to learn so much and also to deploy this on my own.    
* Project status: working
